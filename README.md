## AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed using an AI-assisted workflow to accelerate
script generation, refactoring, and documentation. All code logic,
security decisions, and final implementations were reviewed, tested,
and validated manually.

AI tools were used as a productivity aid, not as a replacement for
technical understanding.
